## About Me
> Iâ€™m a first-year Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student whoâ€™s completely hooked on all things tech. My core interests revolve around IoT, hacking, networking, and machine learning. I love breaking things down, figuring out how they work, and then building something smarter with that knowledge. Whether it's running experiments on my Raspberry Pi or diving deep into ML algorithms, I'm always trying to connect theory with hands-on innovation.

## Portfolio Highlights
### My Projects
- Still in my first year, but Iâ€™ve already started exploring practical stuff. For example, Iâ€™ve worked on image recognition using the Raspberry Pi camera moduleâ€”small steps toward combining hardware and AI.

## Community & Leadership
Iâ€™m currently a member of the IEEE student branch in my college. While I havenâ€™t held leadership positions yet, I enjoy learning from the community and collaborating on anything tech-related. I'm looking forward to getting more involved as I build my skillset.

## Networking & Growth
I'm pretty active on LinkedIn and always on the lookout for like-minded folks to connect with. Whether itâ€™s tech discussions, collabs, or just sharing knowledge, I believe in growing through community.

## Short-Term Goal:
Learning machine learning with Pythonâ€”getting a solid grip on models, libraries, and applying it to real projects.

## Long-Term Vision:
I want to land an AI-focused role at Technopark, work on impactful tech, and eventually mentor others who are just starting out.

## Thoughts on Keralaâ€™s Tech Ecosystem
I have high hopes for Keralaâ€™s startup and tech scene. Thereâ€™s a lot of talent here, especially among students, and if we push more hands-on innovation, real-world problem-solving, and better access to mentorship, we can build something great. Technopark is already a hubâ€”but Iâ€™d love to see more AI startups, student-led projects, and industry-academia collabs. The potentialâ€™s definitely thereâ€”we just need to tap into it harder.

## Open Source Contributions
Havenâ€™t contributed to open source yet, but itâ€™s on my radar. Iâ€™m currently learning how to get started with beginner-friendly repos that align with my interests in AI and networking.

## Content Creation
I run a blog where I share my journey in networkingâ€”from being a complete noob to reaching a point where I can understand and break down networks with confidence. Itâ€™s not entirely technical, but itâ€™s real and I hope it helps others starting out too. Planning to expand into ML, IoT, and web dev content soon.
